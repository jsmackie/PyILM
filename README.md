PyILM is a computer simulation of language transmission, with a focus on sound systems. It was built for my 2016 PhD dissertation. Instructions for using PyILM can be found in the second chapter of the dissertation. This chapter can also be downloaded from the github page. Look for a file named "PyILM_documentation.pdf". 

Questions or comments can be sent to mr.jsmackie@gmail.com. Please put "pyilm" somewhere in your subject line.
