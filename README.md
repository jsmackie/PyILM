PyILM is a computer simulation of language transmission, with a focus on sound systems. It was built for my 2016 PhD dissertation. Instructions for using PyILM can be found in the second chapter of the dissertation. A PDF of that chapter can be downloaded from here as well. Questions or comments can be sent to mr.jsmackie@gmail.com. Please put "pyilm" somewhere in your subject line.
